1. All BMS units must be separated physically so that any abnormal issue within a BMS unit will not spread to other units.

2. There should be more than a minimum number of nominally identical equipment or
subsystems in the fault detection, control, and communication unit of the BMS. If one component or subsystem fails, the other can perform as a backup for a random failure, this is called “fail-safe philosophy.” The “fail-safe philosophy” includes safety vents, thermal fuses, and shutdown separators. Safety vents reduce the excess pressure inside the battery and prevent the rise of battery temperatures. Fallback protection, in particular, is exceptionally vital. If the primary protection system fails, then the second option will retain viability to prevent further problems.

3. The battery cell must not be discharged below the minimum specified SOC.
