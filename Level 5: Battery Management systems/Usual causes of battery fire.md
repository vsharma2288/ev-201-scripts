Below are some of the usual causes of battery fire:

1. Faulty electrical and mechanical design.
2. Production quality deficiency issues with the cells.
3. Flawed or no battery monitoring.
4. Defective charging/discharging process.
5. Lack of test for battery and BMS.
6. Bad cell/pack level testing.
7. Cycle life (charge/discharge cycling).
8. Cycle life (simulated drive/usage profiles).
9. HPCC (hybrid pulse power characterization).
10. Overcharge.
11. Short circuit.
12. Mechanical shock.
13. Thermal/humidity cycling.
14. Thermal shock.
15. Altitude.
16. Simulated environment: vibration, temperature, humidity.
17. Failure analysis.
18. BMS simulation and monitoring.
19. Connector/service disconnect cycling and durability.
