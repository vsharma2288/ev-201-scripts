In general, A BMS refers to a management system that monitors, controls, and optimizes an individual cell's performance or multiple battery modules in an energy storage system. 

BMS can control the disconnection
of the module(s) from the system in the event of abnormal conditions. It is used to improve battery performance with proper safety measures within a system.

Now that you have seen what happens if you don't use a BMS when working with Li-ion cells. Let's understand the main functionalities of a battery management system.
