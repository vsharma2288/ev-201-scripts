# Recommendations for BMS Structure
1. A non-flammable and solid barrier should be used between the two electrodes of
batteries. The barrier must be made of insulation material, and electrodes should
never come into contact with each other, even if an accident occurs. The barrier
ensures the internal short circuit of batteries.

2. Since the battery is one of the inputs of BMS, flame retardants can be used in the electrolytes of batteries to prevent fire. The flash point of retardants must be higher than the electrolytes. However, measures should be taken to prevent battery performance and the electrochemical reactor from being hindered.

3. In a battery, the combustion process includes a series of chemical reactions, which may cause a fire. To prevent this, fuel, oxidizer, and control unit must be chosen in such a way that the battery is not exposed to fire or any abnormality.
