1. Two well-known safety strategies are available in the lithium battery: 
   1. Current interrupt devices (CID) and 
   2. Positive temperature coefficient (PTC). 

The PTC protects batteries from an external short circuit. In abnormal cases, the PTC will heat itself, increase its resistance, and block the excess current. The CID prevents current flow in an abnormal condition, which may cause gas generation. It is highly recommended to implement these techniques for ensuring BMS reliability.

2. A new solvent with a higher flash point than the existing solvent is recommended to use in batteries for fire resistance. As the battery is a part of the BMS, the development of a new solvent will reduce the probability of a BMS fire.

3. A gas sensor is capable of tracking volatile organic compounds (VOC) from leaked electrolytes. Hence, gas sensors can be a cost-efficient way to enhance the safety of the BMS.
