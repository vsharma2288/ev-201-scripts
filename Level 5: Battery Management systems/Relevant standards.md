## Standards/guidelines for transportation electrification


## 1. ISO 6469-1:2019 Edition 3.0—Electrically propelled road vehicles—Safety specifications—Part 1: On-board rechargeable energy storage system (RESS)

This standard specifies requirements for the on-board rechargeable energy
storage system for electrically propelled vehicles such as hybrid-electric
vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. It mainly discusses
climatic, electrical, functional, and simulated vehicle accident requirements. It
also does not comprise motorcycles or other vehicles which are not designated
as electric vehicles such as fork-lift trucks. The document does not consider the
safety procedure for manufacturing, maintenance, and repair personnel.

## 2. ISO 6469-3:2018, Electrically propelled road vehicles—Safety specifications—Part 3: Electrical safety

This standard specifies electrical safety requirements of voltage class B electric
circuits of electric propulsion systems and electrically propelled road vehicles.
It specifies electrical safety requirements for the protection of persons against
electric shock and thermal incidents. However, it does not explain the safety
measures for maintenance, manufacturing, and repair personnel.

## 3. ISO/TR 11955:2008, Hybrid-electric road vehicles—Guidelines for charge balance measurement

These guidelines explain the charge balance measurement procedure of hybrid
electric vehicles (HEV) with batteries. The document does not consider any
test for fully electric vehicles (EV). The “charge balance” term refers to the
capacity of the battery.

## 4 SAE J2289_200807—Electric-Drive Battery Pack System: Functional Guidelines

These guidelines describe the electrical, physical, environmental, safety, and
labelling requirements with product description, and shipment characteristics
of the battery system for vehicles. These vehicles use a rechargeable battery to
recapture the traction energy. They also explain the abnormal condition of the
battery system.

----

## 5. SAE J2288_200806—Life Cycle Testing of Electric Vehicle Battery Modules

This standard describes a test method to determine the life cycle of EV battery
modules. By using a set of nominal or baseline operating conditions, the
expected degradation in electrical performance as a function of battery life is
determined and a possible failure mechanism is identified.

## 6. SAE J1798—Recommended Practice for Performance Rating of Electric Vehicle Battery Modules

This standard covers general test and verification methods to determine EV
battery module performance. It provides the required performance in order to
identify basic and minimum performance specifications of EV battery modules.

## 7.  UL 583, Standard for Electric-Battery-Powered Industrial Trucks

This standard addresses the requirements for electric-battery-powered
industrial trucks, such as fork-lift trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, and
other industrial application-specific vehicles in accordance with the three most
important risks: fire, explosion, and electric shock. However, there are also
some other risks that are involved in this kind of equipment, such as corrosion,
acid spill, and acid splash, etc. are not discussed in the document.

## 8. ISO 18300:2016(E), Electrically propelled vehicles—Test specifications for lithium-ion battery systems combined with lead-acid battery or capacitor

This standard discusses the combination of lithium-ion batteries with lead-acid
battery or electric double-layer capacitor. The series combination of
rechargeable chemical battery and double layer capacitor is an excellent
solution for EV fast-charging station. However, the current and voltage spikes,
during energy transfer between battery and electric double-layer capacitor,
may reduce the system performance. In addition, the standard only addresses
low voltage battery packs (e.g., 12V, 48V), design, test procedures, and safety
requirements for high voltage batteries are not covered in the document.

Recently, several numbers of accidents are listed in high-energy batteries of EVs. It is also reported that the accidents are because of inadequate fire safety measures in BMS. There are other factors, which cause risks in EV batteries.

> It is best to follow the recommended guidelines while designing your batteries and battery management systems.
