There are two kinds of 'fuels' that can be used in electric cars. They're called alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power. The power that comes from the grid or your household plugs is always AC. However, batteries, like the one in your EV, can only store power as DC. That's why most electronic devices have a converter built into the plug. You may not realize it but every time you're charging a device such as your smartphone, the charger is actually converting AC power to DC.

### AC charging for electric vehicles
When it comes to electric vehicles, the converter is built inside the car. It's called the "onboard charger" though it really is a converter. It converts power from AC to DC and then feeds it into the carâ€™s battery. This is the most common charging method for electric vehicles today and most chargers use AC power. 

### DC charging for electric vehicles
As we've learned, power from the grid is always AC. The difference between AC charging and DC charging is the location where the AC power gets converted, inside or outside the car. Unlike AC chargers, a DC charger has a converter inside the charger itself. 

Let's learn more about different levels in AC and DC charging for charging electric vehicles and how they fare against each other.
