Now That we have learned a bit about designing a battery management system and understood why it is necessary for an electric vehicle battery, let's now learn the importance of an EV charger.

An EV charger is basically a direct replacement for a regular fuel pump that is available in petrol/diesel stations. But instead of pumping petrol into the tank, EV chargers pump electricity into your EV batteries and unlike going to fuel stations to get petrol, you can charge your EV at home while you sleep.

But you might be wondering, why would we need a separate charger to charge our batteries, instead of just connecting the negative and positive wire of a power supply to a battery terminal to charge it? 

That is what we will be learning in this chapter. We will understand what an EV charger does, its responsibilities and the types of chargers depending on the vehicle type.

>Electric vehicle charging stations are also called as EVSEs, **EVSE** is short for electric vehicle supply equipment. 

The EVSEs main job is to deliver electrical energy from an electricity source to charge an EVâ€™s batteries. It communicates with the EV to ensure that an appropriate and safe flow of electricity is supplied.
