Let's look at what you won't be learning in this level, 

Unlike previous levels where we built our own small primitive prototypes of the subjects we were learning, we won't be learning how to build a charger prototype, as it is quite dangerous and also complicated without in-depth knowledge. 

We will only be concentrating on how to select the best charging standard for your application and also learn about all the available charging standards and methods out there.
