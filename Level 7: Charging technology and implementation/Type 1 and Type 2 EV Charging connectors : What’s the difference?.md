Most Electric Vehicles are equipped with an inbuilt charger through which they can easily charge the vehicles from the normal main supply. Some vehicles, however, will require an additional charging cable that will allow the owners to charge their cars away from home.

As we have seen in the previous lesson, all charging cables are not the same, they either have a Type 1 or Type 2 plug on one end that largely depends upon the charging standards of the electric vehicle being charged.

Let's look at what differentiates Type 1 from Type 2 connectors 

## Differences between the two variants of EV charging cables

* Type 1 inlet is the Asian, Japanese, and American standard of charging cables whereas, in Europe, the Type 2 inlet is the standard.

* To keep the plugin in place and to prevent it from falling out of the socket, the Type 1 plug comes with a latch, whereas Type 2 plugs donâ€™t have a latch.

* Vehicles that support the Type 2 plug have a locking pin that locates and secures the plug in place and prevents it from falling out. This way, only car owners will be able to unplug the charging cable from the car end. Whereas, vehicles that support Type 1 plug do not come with a lock pin and therefore anyone will be able to unplug the charging cable from the car.

* Both Type 1 and Type 2 plugs contain pins that carry power and safe ground.
* Type 1 is a single-phase charging cable whereas Type 2 charging cable allows both single-phase and 3-phase main power to be connected to the vehicle.

Now that we have understood all the different types of connectors and the levels of charging present in the electric vehicle charging architecture, let's have a look at how the vehicle and the charger communicate and initiate their charging.
