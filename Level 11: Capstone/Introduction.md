Welcome to the final level of the course!

Here, we'll go through everything that we have done in the previous levels one by one as a recap, and learn to apply all of that together into one project. 

As seen in the image above, we will be building a 3 pole motor from **Level 2**, once you have done that, we will go ahead and design a better Motor controller to control our motor just like we learned in **Level 3**.

Next, we will build a battery monitoring system (BMS) that we learned in **Level 6** to monitor and connect or disconnect the AA batteries that we built in Level 5.

And in the end, to top it all off, we will be connecting the BMS from **Level 6** and the Motor controller from **level 3** via i^2^c communication.
