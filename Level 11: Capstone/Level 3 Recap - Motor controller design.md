Now that we looked at how we built a Motor in level 2, let's look at what we did to get the motor running in level 3. 

Let's take the example of a donkey following a carrot.

Caption: The magnets on the rotor are the Donkeys. the moving magnetic field is the carrot.

Here, let's assume the energized coil in the motor above that is producing a magnetic field is a carrot, and the magnets on the rotor are individual donkeys.

Every time you energize a nearby coil, from the example, the donkey (Magnet) gets attracted towards it and moves towards the carrot (Coil), and the carrot moves to the next coil and so on and so forth. 

This continuous process keeps attracting the magnet and rotates the center shaft or the rotor.

This is basically how a motor works. 

Now, this motor is only working with one motion, i.e. pulling. 

This motor configuration works only by attracting the magnet towards an active pole and continuing the process. But in reality, motors used in vehicles and other applications use two different motions to produce more power and be much more efficient. 

They act by pulling as well as pushing the magnet. This gives a lot more energy to the rotor and produces significantly more torque. 

Let's move on to the next level.
