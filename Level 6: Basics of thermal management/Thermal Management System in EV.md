Previously, we saw the generation of heat in different components and explored various solutions to dissipate heat from the system. We also understood the need to heat some components at various ambient conditions. Electric vehicles (EVs) have a specific system designed to efficiently manage the generated heat and provide necessary heating. In the context of 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler applications, these systems are relatively simple, especially for Indian conditions, where air-cooled systems often function well. However, in the 4-wheeler segment, the thermal system becomes more complex, and many research and development activities are ongoing to optimize its performance. In the Thermal management system it covers the complete vehicle cooling and heating needs, including the cabin.

Let’s understand the conventional thermal management system available in an ICE vehicle, it is typically for cabin cooling to maintain the desired temperature and humidity. So in general it is called Air conditioning system.

### **Parts of System and its functionality:**

**1) Working Fluid:** An AC system utilizes refrigerant as its working fluid. The refrigerant needs to possess specific thermodynamic characteristics, including a low boiling point, low freezing point, positive pressures (although not excessively high) in both the condenser and evaporator, high saturation temperature, and a high latent heat of vaporization.
Over time, various types of refrigerants have been explored for air conditioning. Initially, toxic and flammable refrigerants such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide, methyl chloride, and propane were used. However, the focus then shifted to non-flammable and non-toxic refrigerants like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) such as R-11 and R-12. Unfortunately, these CFCs were found to cause damage to the ozone layer.
In response to stricter requirements imposed by automobile manufacturers, new refrigerants were introduced, including HCFC (R-22), HFC (R-134a), and HFOs (R1234yf, R1233zd). These alternatives were chosen to mitigate environmental concerns. Furthermore, there are ongoing discussions regarding the use of CO2 as a refrigerant in modern times.

**2) Compressor:** The compressor takes in the low-pressure refrigerant from the evaporator through suction port, compresses it to a high pressure while simultaneously raising its temperature, and then sends it out through the discharge port in gaseous state. In internal combustion engine (ICE) systems, the compressor is typically driven by the engine itself. There are various types of compressors, including positive displacement and scroll compressors. Scroll compressors, in particular, are commonly utilized in automotive applications.

**3) Condenser and Fan:** The condenser transfers heat to the surrounding environment. It is designed with specific flow paths and fins, which allow the high-pressure and high-temperature refrigerant to expand and cool down as air is blown over the condenser by the fans. As a result, the gaseous refrigerant releases heat and undergoes a conversion into liquid refrigerant at this stage.

**4) Drier:** This absorbs the moisture in the refrigerant (if any), this locates after the condenser.

**5) Expansion Valve:** The liquid refrigerant now travels through high-pressure tubing in the direction of your car's dashboard, passing through a small valve. This valve, depending on your vehicle, may be referred to as a thermal expansion valve or an orifice tube. As it passes through this valve, the refrigerant undergoes a transition back to a low-pressure gas state.
The valve's function is to regulate the flow of refrigerant, allowing only a small amount to pass through at a time, while also alleviating the pressure generated by the compressor. An interesting phenomenon occurs when the pressure is suddenly reduced: the refrigerant becomes extremely cold. This cold refrigerant is used for cabin cooling eventually.

**6) Evaporator and Fan:** Next, the cold and low-pressure refrigerant enters the evaporator, which functions similarly to a radiator and is situated in the dashboard of your car. However, in this case, the refrigerant's cold temperature causes the radiator to cool the surrounding air, instead of the air cooling the radiator. An electric blower fan is employed to propel the cold air through the vents and into the passenger cabin.

**7) Accumulator:** This locates after the evaporator, this acts as a reservoir, filter and moisture eliminator.
Following this, the cycle repeats. The system includes a control unit that manages the cooling of the cabin based on the input provided by the driver.

### **Thermal management system in EVs:**

The thermal management system in electric vehicles (EVs) is more complex compared to conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) due to additional cooling and heating requirements. While ICEs primarily focus on cabin cooling, EVs require a comprehensive thermal management system that addresses various aspects. In EVs, the thermal system design and efficiency play a crucial role in vehicle performance and range, thus receiving higher priority.

Please take a look at the following research article link: https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/hvac-is-killing-your-range

The influence of winter on the electric vehicle (EV) range is evident from the range data of various remarkable EV models. When analyzing this data, it becomes apparent that there is a significant reduction in range during the winter months, primarily because of the increased need for heating. As a result, having an effective thermal system becomes crucial for maintaining optimal range, even when faced with challenging winter and summer conditions. The term "COP" (Coefficient of Performance) is used to gauge the efficiency of these thermal systems.


Below is one example of EV thermal management system, as you see it is more complicated than conventional ICE vehicle, it has many sub-systems.

Here are some key sub-systems of EV thermal management systems:

**Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS):** The BTMS is responsible for cooling or heating the battery pack to maintain its optimal operating temperature range. This system can have different configurations and parts depending on the cooling/heating technique opted.  It typically consists of cooling plates, coolant pumps, a heat exchanger, a refrigerant or coolant fluid, thermal management controller, temperature sensors etc

**Heat Pump:** Some EVs employ a heat pump system to provide efficient cabin heating and cooling. The heat pump utilizes a refrigerant cycle to transfer heat from outside the vehicle to the cabin during winter for heating purposes and removes heat from the cabin to the outside during summer for cooling.

### **Optimisation of EV thermal management system and waste heat recovery:**

To optimize the thermal management system and maximize the performance of electric vehicles (EVs), a comprehensive approach is necessary. The complexity and significance of EV thermal management in the overall vehicle design emphasize the need for careful optimization. Managing heat flow effectively and considering it at the system level is crucial. To achieve this, a system modeling approach is recommended, and tools like Matlab or G-suite can be utilized. It is essential to capture all possible operating conditions and duty cycles of the vehicle during the design process.

While reducing heat losses is important, it is equally critical to efficiently manage the generated heat. In the realm of EVs, various waste heat recovery techniques have been explored, including:

**Thermoelectric Generators:** These devices convert waste heat into electricity using the Seebeck effect.

**Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Systems:** ORC systems use waste heat to generate power by employing organic fluids with low boiling points.

**Heat Pump Systems:** Heat pumps transfer heat from a low-temperature source (such as ambient air) to a higher temperature, enabling waste heat recovery.

**Thermal Storage such as Phase Change Materials (PCMs):** PCMs can store and release thermal energy, allowing for more efficient heat management.

**Cooling System Heat Recovery:** Heat recovered from the cooling system can be utilized for other purposes, such as cabin heating or preheating the battery.

By implementing these waste heat recovery techniques, EVs can optimize energy utilization, improve overall efficiency, and enhance the performance of the vehicle's thermal management system.
