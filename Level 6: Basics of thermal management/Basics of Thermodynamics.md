# Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is typically considered as one of the toughest subject, and it is. It is considered that the entire universe works based on thermodynamics principles. Here we will try to understand some basic terms and laws of thermodynamics which is required later in this course, so we are not getting into depth, because it is not the scope of this course. 

So let’s start, thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat, energy, and work.The word thermodynamics is derived from two Greek words, where “Therme” means heat and “Dynamics” means motion, so thermodynamics means heat in motion. It's a fascinating field that helps us understand how energy moves and changes within a system. To grasp the concept intuitively, imagine a closed system, like a sealed container filled with gas. When you heat the gas, the molecules inside begin to move faster, which leads to an increase in the overall temperature of the system. 

**Let's explore the reasons behind this occurrence.**

When you heat a gas, the increase in temperature occurs because of the increase in kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. When heat is added to a gas, its internal energy increases, causing the gas molecules to move more rapidly and vigorously.

In a gas, molecules are in constant motion, moving in random directions at various speeds. They collide with each other and the container walls. When heat is applied, the energy is transferred to these molecules during collisions. As a result, the molecules gain kinetic energy, and their average speed increases. The increase in average speed directly correlates with an increase in temperature.

In simple terms, heating a gas means supplying energy to its molecules, which causes them to move faster and more vigorously, leading to a rise in temperature throughout the system. This phenomenon applies to various gases and is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics.

This is an example of how energy can be transferred from one form to another.

Now, observe that atomic structures are not stationary; instead, they vibrate. The atoms constituting your skin on your hand are continuously vibrating. Heat, in essence, is the kinetic energy arising from these vibrations within the atoms present in these structures. Consequently, all atoms possess kinetic energy as a result of this internal vibration.

Another important concept in thermodynamics is entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. As a system moves towards equilibrium, the entropy increases, and the overall energy of the system becomes more evenly distributed. To give you an example, think about mixing hot and cold water in a bathtub. At first, the hot and cold water are separated, but as you mix them, the temperature becomes more uniform, and the water becomes more disordered or random. This is an illustration of how entropy increases as the system moves towards equilibrium.

You can also explore practical applications of thermodynamics in daily life, such as how refrigerators work, or how the human body regulates its temperature. Basically all of them work on laws of thermodynamics.

## Let’s go through the Laws of thermodynamics



**First Law of thermodynamics**
> Law states “Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another”

The first law of thermodynamics is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics that relates to the conservation of energy. In simple terms, it states that the change in internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the heat energy added to the system minus the work done by the system. This law can be expressed mathematically as ΔU=Q−W, where ΔU represents the change in internal energy, Q represents the heat added to the system, and W represents the work done by the system. This means that any increase in the internal energy of the system must be accounted for by the heat added to the system and the work done by the system.

This law defines the Heat, Work and Energy, it is also called law of conservation of energy.

**Second Law of thermodynamics**

>“The entropy in an isolated system always increases. Any isolated system spontaneously evolves towards thermal equilibrium—the state of maximum entropy of the system”

**Third Law of thermodynamics**

>“The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero”

**Zeroth law of thermodynamics**

>“If two bodies are individually in equilibrium with a separate third body, then the first two bodies are also in thermal equilibrium with each other”
