The efficiency of a PMSM motor typically falls within the range of 90% to 95%. But what occurs with the remaining 5% to 10% of the input power? In most instances, this portion of input power transforms into heat loss. To illustrate, consider an inverter delivering 10kW of AC input power to the PMSM. If, at a specific operational juncture, the motor has an efficiency of 93%, it implies that the motor will generate 700W of heat. Now, let's delve into the mechanisms behind the generation of this heat and explore the different types of losses within the motor that contribute to this heat production.

## **Different types of losses in a Motor**

## **Ohmic or I2R Loss**

Ohmic losses, also known as copper losses, is an electrical loss, occuring in the windings of the stator and are influenced by resistance and current. These losses can be divided into frequency-dependent and frequency-independent components. Frequency-independent losses are determined by wire dimensions and material properties, such as the length and cross-sectional area of the wire. Higher motor temperatures increase resistance and consequently lead to increased losses. Cooling the motor effectively is crucial to prevent excessive temperature rise in the windings. Frequency-dependent losses rise with increasing frequency due to the skin effect. The skin effect is a phenomenon that occurs in electrical conductors, such as wires and cables, when they carry alternating current (AC) at high frequencies. It causes the current to concentrate near the surface of the conductor, reducing the effective cross-sectional area available for current flow. As a result, the effective resistance of the conductor increases, leading to higher losses. To mitigate this effect, thicker wires can be divided into multiple separate wires, although this may increase resistance due to the proximity effect. When multiple conductors are placed close to each other and carry AC currents, the magnetic fields generated by each conductor affect the neighboring conductors. This interaction causes a non-uniform distribution of current within each conductor, with more current flowing in the regions closer to the adjacent conductors and less current flowing in the regions farther away. As a result, the effective resistance of each conductor increases due to the proximity effect. Induction motors also experience significant ohmic losses in the rotor, making rotor cooling challenging. For instance, Tesla employs liquid cooling of the shaft in their induction motors.

## **Core Loss or Iron loss**

Core losses, also called as Iron losses, is an electrical loss,  encompassing hysteresis losses and eddy current losses. These losses are expressed per unit weight and depend on factors such as frequency and maximum flux density. Higher rotational speeds increase core losses. Losses vary based on the material and its manufacturing process. Stator and rotor components primarily contribute to iron losses, although eddy current losses can also occur in permanent magnets. While losses in magnets are typically small, they are critical due to their limited temperature resistance.

Hysteresis losses occur when magnetic materials undergo magnetization and remagnetization, resulting in losses due to the changing magnetic orientations of small domains within the material. Soft magnetic materials with small hysteresis curves, such as electrical sheets, are employed to minimize hysteresis losses.

Eddy current losses arise from variations in the magnetic flux within the stator. These currents generate losses and heat in the stator. To mitigate these losses, the stator is divided into separate laminations that are insulated from each other. Thinner laminations further reduce eddy current losses.

## **Windage loss**

It is a mechanical loss, and due to friction between rotating part and surrounding medium, usually air (it can be oil or refrigerant in some cases based on motor cooling design). Windage loss increases as rotating speed and density of surrounding medium increase. Windage loss also depends on maximum diameter and length of rotating part. Flow nature of air (or other medium) around the rotating parts as an influence on the windage loss. Windage loss can be calculated using below formulae. Windage loss will be negligible in air medium within 4000 RPMs.

Bearing Frictional loss:

It is a mechanical loss and basically due to friction in rolling elements of bearing. Proper lubrication is important to reduce the loss. Also lubricant as to work at various operating temperatures and speed, right selection of bearing very much crucial to reduce the loss.

## **Motor duty cycles**

IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) uses eight duty cycle designations to describe electrical motor operating conditions:

| Motor Duty cycles |||
| --- | ----------- |------------------|
| S1| Continuous duty |The motor operates at constant load until it reaches a state of temperature equilibrium.|
| S2| Short-time duty |The motor functions under a constant load, yet it doesn't operate long enough to achieve temperature equilibrium. The intervals between activities are sufficiently extended for the motor to cool to ambient temperature.|
| S3| Intermittent periodic duty |Sequential, identical patterns of operation and rest with a constant load. Equilibrium in temperature is not achieved. The initial current has minimal impact on temperature elevation.|
| S4| Intermittent periodic duty with starting |Sequential, identical sequences of start-up, operation at constant load, and idling with a steady load. Temperature equilibrium remains unattainable, but the initial current influences temperature increase.|
| S5| Intermittent periodic duty with electric braking|Sequential, identical sequences of initiation, operation under constant load, and operation with no load. No intermission periods.|
| S6| Continuous operation with intermittent load |Sequential, identical patterns of operation under constant load and operation with no load. No intermission periods.|
| S7| Continuous operation with electric braking |Sequential, uniform cycles involving initiation, operation under constant load, and application of electric braking. No intermission periods.|
| S8| Continuous operation with periodic changes in load and speed |Sequential, identical duty cycles include running at a constant load and specific speed, followed by running at other constant loads and speeds. No breaks between these cycles.|

## **Thermal Class**

Motor thermal class refers to a standard classification system used to indicate the maximum allowable operating temperature of an electric motor's insulation system. It provides information about the temperature resistance and thermal capabilities of the motor's insulation materials. The thermal class rating is typically determined by the motor's insulation system and is an important factor in motor design, selection, and operation.
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) have established standards for motor thermal classes, they are as follows.

|Class|Temp.|Ambient|Hotspots|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|105℃|+40℃|+5℃|
|B|130℃|+40℃|+10℃|
|F|155℃|+40℃|+10℃|
|H|180℃|+40℃|+15℃|

All above temperatures are after thermal equilibrium. It is usual to see the temperature difference within the stator. Hotspots define the max possible temperature differences.

## **Different Magnets used in Motors and their thermal limits**

Temperature has an effect on magnets, influencing their magnetic characteristics. As temperature rises, the magnet's properties are affected. When a magnet is exposed to temperatures exceeding its maximum operational threshold, it will lose its magnetization. This phenomenon is termed "Demagnetization" or the "Curie temperature," and it can have consequences for the motor's lifespan. The table below provides information about the highest temperatures at which different magnets, employed in motors, can function effectively.

|Magnets|Maximum Operating Temperature in ℃ |
|---|--------|
|Ferrite Magnet|250|
|Samarium Cobalt (Sm-Co)  Magnet |310-400|
|Neodymium Iron Boron (Nd-Fe-B) Magnet |M (80-100), H (100-120), SH (120-150), UH (150-180), EH (180-200). 
Here M, H, SH, UH, EH are the grades of magnet.


It's worth mentioning that these temperature thresholds are approximate and subject to variability based on variables like magnet grade, dimensions, geometry, and the particular usage context. Surpassing the advised temperature boundaries may result in demagnetization, reduction in magnetic potency, or permanent harm to the magnet. As a result, it's essential to account for the application's temperature needs and pick the suitable magnet material that can function within the desired temperature scope, ensuring the best performance and prolonged usefulness.

### **How to keep a watch on Motor winding temperature?**

Usually, a thermal sensor is used in the stator winding to measure the stator temperatures actively. Thermal sensor output is connected to the controller/inverter to derate the motor performance in case winding temperature crosses the set temperature limit. During the derating motor performance will drop because during the derating input current to the motor is reduced.


Here are the few commonly used sensor types on stator windings

1) Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors: 
NTC thermistor is a resistor that experiences a small change in resistance as the temperature varies. It provides a higher resistance at low temperatures, and as the temperature increases, the resistance decreases. The output of an NTC thermistor is non-linear but can be linearized based on its application. The effective operating range is -50 to 250 °C for glass encapsulated thermistors or 150°C for standard thermistors. 

2) Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs): RTD changes its resistance with temperature. It consists of a film or wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. Platinum makes up the most accurate RTDs while nickel and copper make RTDs that are lower cost. Platinum RTDs offer a highly accurate linear output across -200 to 600 °C but are much more expensive than copper or nickel. 

3) Thermocouples: Thermocouple consists of two wires of different metals bonded at two points. The varying voltage created between these two dissimilar metals reflects proportional changes in temperature. Thermocouples are nonlinear and require a conversion with a table when used for temperature control and compensation. Accuracy is low, from 0.  °C to 5 °C, but thermocouples operate across the widest temperature range, from -200 °C to 1750 °C.

## **Heat Transfer Model of Motor**

The image above illustrates the elements of heat generation, thermal resistance, and thermal capacity within a motor. In this context, the heat source refers to components responsible for heat production, which, in the case of a motor, includes the stator and rotor.

Generated heat can be transferred through both an axial path and a radial path. However, certain resistances impede heat transfer, and they encompass:

1) Air gap
2) Thermal conductivity of the housing material
3) Bearings
4) Gaps between copper wires within the winding
5) Insulation between the winding and the stator core
6) Heat naturally gravitates towards paths of lower resistance.

A substantial portion of the heat from the rotor follows an axial route via the shaft, bearings, housing, and eventually into the coolant. Conversely, less heat transfers radially through the rotor due to the presence of an air gap and the increased insulation effect of air. This can be enhanced by facilitating efficient airflow over the rotor or altering the coolant medium around or through the rotor.

In the stator's case, the primary heat flow occurs radially. Given the direct contact between the stator and the typically metal housing material (often aluminum), which boasts superior thermal conductivity, heat predominantly flows radially.

Within the stator, the primary heat source is the coils or windings. These coils are insulated from the stator core, and gaps exist between the copper wires and between the coils, serving as thermal insulators. To optimize heat transfer, techniques such as varnishing or potting are applied to the stator. These methods enhance the heat transfer capacity of the copper wire, leading to improved thermal distribution throughout the stator.

### **Methods of Motor Cooling:**

There are multiple ways to cool the motor which is used in EVs. These cooling methods are considered during the design phase of the motor to achieve the optimized solution in terms of material usage and compactness. Thermal class is defined based on a particular cooling method.

**1) Air Cooling**

Here the motor is cooled by the air, either by forced air or natural flow of air. This is a common cooling method in 2 wheelers. There will be fins provided on motor housing for better heat convection with air. Here forced air is generated by a in built or external fan.This can be seen in Ather scooters.  Natural flow of air is also used for cooling, this is achieved by diverting the air flow on motor fins by using the vents and flow channel. In this case airflow happens due to movement of vehicles. This kind of cooling is also seen in OLA and Simple energy scooters.

**2) Oil Cooling**

Oil is a good conductor of heat, it is typically used in IC Engine and gearbox cooling from decades in ICE vehicles. Special grades of oils and additives are used for motor cooling purposes. Below are some of the required properties of Cooling Oil for electric motors.

- Should be highly compatible with motor material since it comes direct contact
- High Dielectric strength, should not break down at operating voltages
- Must have low electrical conductivity
- High thermal conductivity
- Low density and viscosity
- Should not be flammable
- Should have high working temperature limit

Here oil is used to extract the heat from the stator and rotor. Oil comes in direct contact with rotor and stator. Internal channels are provided in stator and rotor for the flow of oil and it jets on to the stator and rotor. This is seen in major EVs like Tesla, Audi and Chevrolet cars.

**3) Water Cooling**

Water along with Glycol with 50:50 ratio used in motor cooling. Here Water + Glycol mixture does not come in direct contact with stator. There flow channels created on the motor housing and rotor, through which water and glycol mixture flows and removes the heat. Here flow rate, flow channels, fins in flow channels and pressure of fluids are important to design the effective cooling.

**4) Refrigerant Cooling**

Refrigerants such as R134a, R1234yf or similar are used in motor cooling. This is the coolant of the HVAC system, the same coolant is used for motor cooling. This can be direct or indirect cooling. In case of direct cooling refrigerant flows inside the motor and indirect cooling refrigerant does not come in contact with the stator directly. Motor cooling will be better with direct cooling compared to other methods, but it is suitable for low speed motors. Because as the speed increases due to the high density of refrigerant windage loss increases exponentially.
