In this chapter, we take a closer look at two very important types of BLDC motors and PMSMs: Sensored and Sensorless.

> The basic difference between sensored motors is, sensored motors know the position and direction of rotation of the motor at all times, whereas sensorless motors don't have that capability.

## Sensored Motors

Sensored BLDC motors/PMSMs are used in applications that require the motor to start up under load (All-electric vehicles start under load). They use Hall sensors embedded into the motor stator. 
The sensor is essentially a switch with a digital output equal to the sensed magnetic field polarity (that is, HI for north and LO for south).

They also use rotary/optical encoders in some motors that require extra precision. But that is a bit complex for now. Let us learn more about hall effect sensor-based motors.

The motor needs a separate Hall sensor for each phase. A single-phase BLDC motor/PMSM only needs one Hall sensor; a three-phase BLDC motor/PMSM needs three. With these sensors, the controller can obtain the rotor position, determine which sector (for example, the Coils in your motor) needs to be switched on, and determine when to apply the power to rotate the motor in a certain direction.

## Sensorless motors 

Sensorless motors exist because hardware-based sensing adds cost for the sensors, wiring, and manufacturing and some applications do not require rotor position or do not usually start with load (for example, Drone/Quadcopter motors).  

Sensorless motors require algorithms to operate using the motor as the sensor. They rely on BEMF information. A typical sensorless brushless motor has permanent magnets fixed on the rotor with the electro-magnets mounted around the edge of the motor. As the motor picks up speed, it starts to generate electro-motive force in the stator coils (For example: If you take a simple motor and connect the terminals to an LED, and spin the motors by hand, you can light up the LED and generate electricity, this generated electricity is by the back-emf generated in the stator coils by the movement of the permanent magnets on the rotor coils).

The critical aspect of this for sensorless brushless motor control is that the frequency generated by this back-EMF is directly proportional to the speed of the motor. Therefore, if a sensorless brushless motor controller can read this frequency, by sampling this BEMF, the rotor position can be deduced and can then determine the speed of the motor and adjust the drive pattern accordingly, eliminating the need for hardware-based sensors.

The main weakness with this method comes at low speeds where the back-EMF is very weak and therefore hard to read reliably. This is why starting up a sensorless brushless motor is a challenge.

Regardless of the motor topology, controlling these machines requires knowing the rotor position so the motor can be efficiently commutated. If the rotor’s revolving magnetic field is generated in a way that fights the stator’s permanent magnets, both the motion and the efficiency of the system suffer.

>Choosing between sensored and sensorless most commonly depends on cost. The choice of BLDC versus PMSM is generally based on performance, as well as cost and other factors.

### Main takeaways : 

* Sensorless control reduces cost because it eliminates the need for extra hardware.
* Because of being cheap to manufacture, sensorless motor control is common in low-cost, variable-speed motor applications such as fans, refrigerator compressors, air conditioners, and many garden tools.
* Applications that need high torque at startup like electric vehicles, require sensored motors.
* The combination of PMSMs with FOC generally provides the highest performance.
* PMSMs generally cost more than BLDC motors (although the difference is decreasing) and control for PMSM is more complex.
