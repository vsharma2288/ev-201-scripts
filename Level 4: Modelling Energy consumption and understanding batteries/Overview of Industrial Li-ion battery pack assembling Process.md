### 1. Cell sorting

Cell sorting is a process of identifying and grouping the cells with similar parameters
and characteristics so that they have a similar performance during operation cycles. 

Cell sorting is the most critical step to assure the safety of the battery pack. There are few cell sorting methods, available for battery pack manufacturers. 

The common sorting method (VCI) is based on:
1. Voltage
2. Capacity, 
3. AC internal impedance. 

The other sorting methods are based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and its equivalent model parameters, charge and discharge voltage curve, dynamic parameters, and thermal behavior.  

In the commonly used VCI method, all the primary characteristic parameters of the cells are matched. 
* The voltage and capacity are measured with the charge-discharge cycle. 

* The AC internal resistance is measured at a constant frequency of 1 kHz with low AC currents. 

The equipment used for the cell sorting process is 
* A standard battery cycler 
* An impedance tester 

The cells with the same operating voltage, capacity, and internal resistance are grouped together in a battery pack, so that consistency and stability of the whole battery pack is assured during its life. 

_The other methods can have better-sorting results but are time-consuming and require extensive data analysis and processing._

>As a trade-off, voltage, capacity and AC internal impedance are used for the cell sorting process.

Typically, a 1-2-1 philosophy is adapted, which means cells within 1% variation in voltage, 2%
variation in capacity and 1% variation in AC internal impedance are grouped together for better
performance of battery pack. 

After the cell sorting process is complete the groups of sorted cells are sent for the welding process.

### 3. Pack Assembly

The modules are assembled in series and parallel configurations to achieve
the final pack level voltage and capacity. The pack is enclosed in a housing and sealed to avoid
any structural damage. Other auxiliary components such as cooling systems and mechanical
connections are made. Finally, the master BMS is installed onto the pack.

### 4. Final Testing and Storage

The pack is tested for uniform charging of all cells and other pack
parameters such as voltage, and impedance. The pack is then stored at 50% SOC in the warehouse as
per first-in-first-out mode (FIFO). The warehouse temperatures are maintained to approximately 25Â°C
for safety and performance. Due to the battery pack's high voltages, they are prone to electrical shock hazards
and appropriate safety measures are taken during storage, handling, and shipping of the packs.

>It is necessary to follow these processes in the defined order so that the quality and performance of the
product is maintained.
