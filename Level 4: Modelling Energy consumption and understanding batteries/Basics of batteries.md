It's necessary to brush up on some of the basics about matter to fully understand and visualize how all the parts of an electric powertrain work and come together.  

Let's start with brushing up on atomic particles and what their properties are.

### What are Atoms?
Atoms are the smallest units into which matter can be divided without the release of electrically charged particles. It also is the smallest unit of matter that has the characteristic properties of a chemical element. As such, the atom is the basic building block of chemistry.

### What are Electrons and ions?
Now that you know what atoms are, let's look into what these charged particles are. The normal state of atoms as seen above is neutral, they contain the same number of protons as electrons. 

An ion is an electrically charged particle produced by either removing electrons from a neutral atom to give a positive ion or adding electrons to a neutral atom to give a negative ion. When an ion is formed, the number of protons does not change.

Neutral atoms can be turned into positively charged ions by removing one or more electrons. A neutral sodium atom for example, contains 11 protons and 11 electrons. By removing an electron from this atom we get a positively charged Na+ ion that has a net charge of +1.
The gain or loss of electrons by an atom to form negative or positive ions has an enormous impact on the chemical and physical properties of the atom.

### What is Electrical current?

An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space.

The moving particles are called charge carriers, which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor. In electric circuits, the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire, as shown above, the atoms do not move through the wire or a conductor. 

All the atoms in a material are always often close to stationary at room temperature. Electric current is produced when the outermost electrons of an atom jump from one atom to another. You can observe this jump if you look at the GIF closely and observe. The negatively charged electron nearest the positively charged battery is drawn into the battery. This creates a positively charged atom (called an ion) which then, in turn, attracts the nearest negatively charged electron. As an electron leaves the atom and is replaced with another electron, each atom changes from a neutral charge to a positive charge and back again.

This continues down the wire. That is basically electricity.

From the image shown above, we can visualize the flow of electrons through a conductor and compare it with the flow of water through a pipe. This analogy can be used to explain Resistance and explain how the diameter of the conductor affects the flow of the charges. Larger Conductors provide less resistance while smaller conductors provide high resistance. 

There are other factors affecting the resistance as well, including conductor material and temperature.

Basically, when temperature increases, atoms receive energy, this makes them vibrate and move around in their place, this effect obstructs the movement of electrons. Imagine riding a bike on a road full of walking cows. Similar is the situation here.

### What is voltage and current?
In simple words, Voltage is the pressure from an electrical circuit's power source that pushes charged electrons (current) through a conducting loop, and Current is the rate at which electric charge flows in a circuit. In other words, the current is the rate of flow of electric charge.

And the current depends on the potential difference in the circuit.

In Fig 6, As the potential difference (V~d~ or Î”V) increases, the current also increases. But what is a potential difference? It can be explained by imagining a car on 2 different ramps with 2 different slopes. 

Potential difference is basically the difference in voltage from the source of the power supply and the ground or the negative terminal of the power supply. Consider the base of the ramp be ground, and the height the peak of the ramp is the voltage difference. The higher the slope is, or higher the voltage difference is, the faster the car moves, i.e. higher the current.

This example was possible because of the difference in potential energy between the two points. Now, What do you mean by energy? Energy in its simplest terms is the ability to do some work. Considering the above example, higher potential energy means the vehicle has a higher capacity to do the work (i.e. increase the speed) higher electrical energy means the circuit has the capacity to do a higher amount of work to make the conductor pass electrons to make an electric current, higher potential/electric energy means there is higher energy given and this is used to drive more current in the conductor.

### Energy density and Power density
Now that you understand how energy plays a role in electricity, now let's understand what we mean by Energy density and Power density,

Considering the previous example again, energy is used to move electrons from one place to another and their speed is determined by the amount of energy given. 

Now, where does this energy come from? Does it need to come from somewhere? That is where batteries and other energy storage devices come in. 
Taking the previous example again. Pushing the car up the hill is basically storing and increasing the potential energy into that car on that ramp. So higher the ramp, the higher the energy. 

That car is basically a type of mechanical battery, also called an energy storage device.

So now that we have a basic idea of an energy storage device/ battery, let's understand what the Energy Density means and what Power density means. 

Energy Density : As the name suggests, energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or a space per unit volume. It can also be used for energy per unit mass, though a more accurate term for this is specific energy (or gravimetric energy density). We will understand more about specific energy later in this level.
