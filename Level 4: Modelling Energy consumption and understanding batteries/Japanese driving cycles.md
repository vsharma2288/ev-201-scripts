## The 10-15 mode cycle

The 10-15 mode Japanese cycle is being used for emissions and fuel consumption certification in Japan. It simulates both urban and motorway cycle, including idling, accelerations, cruising and decelerations. The measurements are performed while the engine is hot, after a standard warming procedure.

Here are the main characteristics of the cycle:


| Distance       | 4.16 km   |
|----------------|-----------|
| Duration       | 660 s     |
| Average speed  | 22.7 km/h |

>This cycle has the same disadvantages as the NEDC, that’s why Japanese authorities and manufacturers decided to switch to a more realistic cycle starting from 2011, the JC08 cycle.

## The JC08 cycle

The JC08 is a *transient cycle* that is much more demanding than the 10-15 mode cycle. It is performed both with a cold and warm start and it represents driving in congested conditions, with strong accelerations and decelerations.

`Transient cycles involve many speed variations, typical of on-road driving conditions.`

Here are the main characteristics of the cycle:

| Distance       | 8.17 km   |
|----------------|-----------|
| Duration       | 1204 s    |
| Average speed  | 24.4 km/h |
