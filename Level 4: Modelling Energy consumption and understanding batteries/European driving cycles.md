## 1. The NEDC Driving Cycle

The NEDC is used as a reference cycle for homologating vehicles until the Euro6 norm in Europe and some other countries. It is made of an urban part called ECE, which is repeated four times, and an extra-urban part, the EUDC.

Here are the main characteristics of the cycle:


* Distance:11023 m
* Duration	:1180 s
* Average speed 	:33.6 km/h

The measurements carried out by this cycle are usually 

* Urban fuel economy (first 780 seconds)
* Extra-Urban fuel economy (780 to 1180 s)
* Overall fuel economy (complete cycle)
* CO2 emission (complete cycle)

### Disadvantages of this Cycle 

**Inability to represent real-life driving**

The test did not replicate real-world driving conditions and had numerous loopholes which cause the results to be unachievable in practice. It was also claimed that no official body polices the tests and the vehicle manufacturers can arbitrarily reduce their results by 4% at the end of the cycle. 

**Weaknesses noted are:** 

1. That tests are not necessarily repeatable and comparable.

2. The test cycle does not include sustained motorway driving. 

3. Test cycles can be performed using optional economy settings which will not typically be selected by drivers.

4. The test cycle is performed with ancillary equipment such as air-conditioning and heated windows switched off.

5. The tests can be conducted at 2 km/h (1.2 mph) below the required speed thus using less fuel.

6. Roof rails and passenger door-mirror can be removed for the test, to reduce drag. 

7. Tyre inflation for the test can be set above the recommended pressure values to artificially reduce rolling resistance.

For the emission standards to deliver real emission reductions, it is crucial to use a test cycle that reflects real-world driving style. However, the fixed speeds, gear shift points, and accelerations of the NEDC offer possibilities for manufacturers to engage in what is called 'cycle beating' to optimize engine emission performance to the corresponding operating points of the test cycle.

>For those reasons, a solution to replace the NEDC is being explored by European authorities. The new cycle called Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been introduced but is yet to be used by Indian manufacturers. That is the reason you will be learning about WLTP simulation.

Let us move on to understand the Driving cycles used by America.
