As you've read in the previous target, a driving cycle is a dataset of vehicle speed points versus time. 

It is used to calculate the fuel consumption and pollutants emissions of a vehicle in a standardized manner so that different vehicles of different companies can be compared and evaluated.

The driving cycle is usually performed on a **chassis dynamometer**, where exhaust emissions of the vehicle are collected and analyzed to assess the emissions rates.

You can watch the video shown below to understand more about "Chassis dynamometers".

In commercial vehicles area, the driving cycle is not performed on a vehicle dynamometer but on an engine dynamometer and is evaluated through a set of engine torque and speed points instead of vehicle speed points.

There are two kinds of driving cycles, 

The modal cycles as the European standard NEDC, or Japanese 10-15 Mode and the transient cycles as the FTP-75 or Artemis cycle. 

The main difference is that modal cycles are a compilation of straight acceleration and constant speed periods and are not representative of real driver behaviour, whereas transient cycles involve many speed variations, typical of on-road driving conditions.

> The Automotive Research Association of India uses a modified version of NEDC and thus are not very useful in getting accurate results in the final energy consumption values for our purposes. 

Let's look at different driving cycles used by different countries.
