### Step 1: Material testing/Cell testing

Testing is done to establish
the cell parameters i.e. voltage,
capacity, cycle life etc.


### Step 2: BMS testing

This step checks
whether the battery protection circuit
functional indicators fall within
the parameter range.

### Step 3: Pasting insulating paper on the positive pole

Small insulating paper is
pasted on the poles of cells to prevent a
short circuit.

### Step 4: Battery Sorting

Batteries are
sorted according to their voltage and
internal resistance. Batteries that have the same voltage and
internal resistance are kept together,
so that consistency and
stability of the whole
battery pack is
assured
during its life.


### Step 5: Putting the cells in brackets and molds

Cells are given a supporting
structure to weld them together. Nickel
strips are also placed in the molds to
weld cells together.

### Step 6: CCD (Critical Current Density) testing

Before welding the
cells, CCD testing is done to
ensure that the positive
and negative poles
of the battery
are above and
below to
prevent short
circuiting.


### Step 7: Welding the cells

Welding of multiple cells provides a
higher capacity
battery. The following welding
techniques are commonly used:
* Spot welding
* Laser welding 
* Bolt welding
* Ultra-sonic welding

Given below are the best welding/joining methods for different types of cells.

### Step 8: Pasting insulation paper and pre-treatment of battery poles

Insulating paper is pasted on
the battery pack to prevent the aging
of PVC and so that chances of short
the circuit is reduced. Pre-treatment of
the battery poles are required to
weld BMS easily.


### Step 9: Connecting BMS

Battery
Management System is connected
to the battery pack, so that it can be
operated in the desired range.


### Step 10: Battery pack testing 

A finished battery pack is tested to
determine the charge and discharge
voltage, charge, and discharge
current and total internal resistance.


### Step 11: Battery aging test

A battery pack is charged and discharged several times and its capacity
is recorded at each charge and discharge to detect the battery charge protection and discharge
protection.
