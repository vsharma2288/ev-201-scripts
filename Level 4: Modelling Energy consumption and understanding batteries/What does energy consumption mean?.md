Energy consumption refers to all the energy used to perform an action, manufacture something or simply inhabit a building.

Letâ€™s look at a few examples:

* In a factory, total energy consumption can be measured by looking at how much energy a production process consumes, for example, by making car parts. This will include, electricity, gas, any energy source needed for the stuffed animals to be made.
* In a household, energy consumption will include electricity, gas, and any other energy used to live in it.
* The energy consumption of a car includes how many liters of diesel or petrol it consumes to cover a certain distance.

All this to clear up the following, energy consumption does not necessarily come from a single energy source. It is a common misconception to think that to save energy you have to save electricity. It could very well be a totally different energy source that has the greatest impact on a certain process.

Looking closely at the definition of energy consumption and going back to our first example, the car parts factory, means we have to consider how an entire production process is evaluated. The process does not end when the car parts are manufactured. If your delivery fleet takes them to the customer, the petrol from that fleet also forms part of your energy consumption.

Energy consumption calculation also helps us calculate the efficiency of your car. But for now, we will only be using these numbers to calculate the size of the battery needed to go a certain range. 

If you have completed EV101 you will be revisiting concepts that you have already learned. But we will be digging a bit deeper into the theory and background regarding calculating energy values. 

If you want to understand the energy efficiency of an electric car compared to petrol cars have a look at the link in the submit tab.

Now, in order to calculate the energy consumption of your vehicle, and benchmark it against other vehicles. You will need a standard testing environment to test all the vehicles in order to compare them.

This standard testing environment is basically called a driving cycle. It is basically a fixed length of road and is split into multiple sections where the vehicle is made to accelerate and brake to mimic real-world driving conditions. There are many different drive cycles used by the world, we will learn more about drive cycles in the next target.
