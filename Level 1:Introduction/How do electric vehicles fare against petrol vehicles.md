Now that we have seen what makes studying electric vehicles important, let's see how they compare with internal combustion engines. Can they compete?


Pure electric vehicles, also called Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), are the long-term solution for mobility compared with Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) powered vehicles.

Battery electric vehicles have some more advantages compared to an internal combustion engine vehicles. Let's take a look at how they compare.

#### 1. Powertrain efficiency	

|Electric vehicle | Internal combustion engine vehicle | 
|-----------------|:-------------|
| Electric vehicles are powered by electric motors and single-speed gearboxes which, depending on the operating point (speed and torque), have an overall efficiency between 75 - 95%. This means that for the same amount of power at the wheel, less energy is used from the high voltage battery compared with an internal combustion engine vehicle |The typical efficiency of an internal combustion engine is between 18 - 24%. Diesel engines have slightly higher efficiency than gasoline engines, but overall, internal combustion engines are 4 times less efficient than electric motors. Compared with an electric motor, for the same amount of wheel power, an internal combustion engine has to consume 4 times more energy |



#### 2. Vehicle acceleration

|Electric vehicle | Internal combustion engine vehicle | 
|-----------------|:-------------|
| A permanent magnet synchronous electric motor has an ideal traction characteristic. Also, at zero speed, the electric motor can deliver the maximum available torque, which translates into very good launch capabilities of the vehicle|An internal combustion engine cannot deliver maximum torque from minimum speed (idle). They also need more time to reach maximum torque because of engine dynamics (air and mechanical inertia, turbo-lag, etc.) |
