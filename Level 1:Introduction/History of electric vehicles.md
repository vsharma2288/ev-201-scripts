It is necessary to understand the history of the electric car, as it's useful to put it into context with the development of personal vehicles in general. 

Electric cars have been around a lot longer than today’s Tesla Motors or even the General Motors EV1 of the late 1990s. 

In fact, electric cars appeared long before the internal-combustion engines, and dreamers have never stopped trying to make them work both on the road and as a business proposition. A lack of historical perspective sometimes leads to misunderstandings of how things came to be as they are now, so let’s take the long view of the road that got us here.

Start in the 1830s, with Scotland’s **Robert Anderson**, whose motorized carriage was built sometime between 1832 and ’39. Batteries (galvanic cells) were not yet rechargeable, so it was more parlour trick (“Look! No horse nor ox, yet it moves!”) than a transportation device. 


Batteries that could be recharged came along in 1859, making the electric-car idea more viable. 



Around 1884, inventor **Thomas Parker** helped deploy electric-powered trams and built prototype electric cars in England.

By 1890, a Scotland-born chemist living in Des Moines, Iowa, named **William Morrison**, applied for a patent on the electric carriage he’d built perhaps as early as 1887. It appeared in a city parade in 1888, according to the Des Moines Register, with front-wheel drive, 4 horsepower, and a reported top speed of 20 mph. It had 24 battery cells that needed recharging every 50 miles. Morrison’s self-propelled carriage was a sensation at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, which was also known as the famed World’s Columbian Exhibition. Morrison himself was more interested in the batteries than in mobility, but he’d sparked the imagination of other inventors.

Early electric cars were an ideal alternative to combustion and steam engines.
Early electric cars found a lucrative market, particularly for use in driving around cities. Some of their main consumers included women who found they were perfect for shorts trips around the city.

Car manufacturers at the time began to take notice and started experimenting with electrical and early hybrid cars. One notable example was Porsche's founder, Ferdinand Porsche, who developed his famous P1 in 1898 (this was also his first-ever car).

**Thomas Edison** also threw his weight behind early electric cars, believing in their superiority over other alternatives, and he worked to develop better-performing batteries. Henry Ford (who happened to be a close friend of Edison) partnered with him in around 1914 to explore options for low-cost electrical cars.

Other developments in petrol engines, like Charles Kettering's electrical starter (and H. J. Dowsing earlier example, in 1896), removed one of the main irritations of the early combustion engines - the hand crank. Electric vehicles received their final blow when road systems were improved and abundant reserves of crude oil began to be discovered. 

These, and other factors, all contributed to the fall of electric cars, and they had all but disappeared by around 1935. The battle seemed to be won, and or the next 30 years combustion engine vehicles would rule supreme.
