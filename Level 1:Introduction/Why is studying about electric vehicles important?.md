## Why do you have to study about designing EVs?

The lack of technicians skilled in EV and its alarming impact on the EV industry is being realized. Read more [here](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/environment/2015/12/02/skills-shortage-means-government-ev-plans-could-fail-warns-imi).

Now that we know a bit of history about electric cars, let's understand why they are important, and why we need to develop more.

The coming decade is expected to be the decade of the fully electric car. With battery prices reportedly falling 73% since 2010, electric cars are expected to be as cheap as fuel-powered cars in the foreseeable future. 

The International Energy Agency cites that by 2020 up to 20 million electric vehicles will be on the roads, a number that is expected to go up to 70 million by 2025. 

Countries around the world are waking up to the potential of e-mobility. 

While China is incentivizing e-mobility with tax breaks, EV credit policies, research subsidies and more, countries like the UK, France, Norway and **India are looking to adopt e-mobility at a larger scale, having expressed the desire to phase out petrol and diesel engines entirely in the coming decades** - [eatmy.news](https://www.eatmy.news/2020/08/electric-cars-future-india-as-case-study.html).

"Over the next two years, demand is expected to rise three-fold to 15,000 but the supply is expected to be 10,000” said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease. “Immediate initiatives are required to address the widening demand-supply gap… The auto industry itself has stepped up its hiring by 30% and IT/EV has been a major contributor.”

Only about 1,000 engineers are currently working on electric vehicles in India, according to TeamLease research. 

Mercedes-Benz, which has one of its largest research centres outside Germany in Bengaluru through Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI), also visits campuses for the selection process.

Tata Motors has identified sustainable transportation as one of the core elements of its strategy. Having faced competition for talent at the campuses, it has focused on building in-house talent.

“The smart way is to develop the talent simultaneously while developing the technologies,”  
said a company spokesperson. “Building talent instead of ‘buying’ or ‘renting’ talent is far more effective - Indiatimes.

By now you know, there is a serious talent crunch regarding electric vehicle engineers or multidisciplinary engineers, which makes this course much more important and valuable to study. 

**So let's continue to our next chapter and learn the Fundamentals of electric vehicles.**
