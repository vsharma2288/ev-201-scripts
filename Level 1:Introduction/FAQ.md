## A new kind of online class
This isn’t your typical “online course”. It’s a fully immersive learning experience. The classroom has been digitized and transformed, allowing you to get a hands-on education and community from anywhere.

### Who is this course for?

This course is for all skill levels, whether you’re new to EV engineering, a hobbyist wanting to learn more, or a more experienced engineer looking to accelerate your growth and expand your skills. The projects are designed so that you can practice and learn on the edge of your own personal abilities.

### How much engineering knowledge and experience do I need to take this course?

This course is packed with information and you’ll likely get different things out of it depending on your level of engineering knowledge.

If you are a complete beginner, don’t worry, you won’t need to have much outside knowledge.

If you have limited knowledge, the class will give you a stronger engineering foundation to build on.

### Are classes live? Do I have to log in at a specific time?

No, all the video lessons are pre-recorded, allowing you to watch them whenever is best for you.

Inside the course, you’ll see a 'Targets' section, where you’ll see the content you should go through and complete. 

You’ll get many of the benefits of learning in-person, but from the comfort of your own home and the flexibility of your own hours.

### What tools and materials will I need for this course?

You’ll need a computer and an Arduino kit for the electrical engineering portions of the class. In fact, selecting and sourcing tools and materials is an essential engineering skill that you’ll learn in this course.

We will walk you through how to choose the base components, that your designs require. The list of components required for this course is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQWHNTrvvria7fBvr8zqusCOKlHA_ItixiajJITqXioZqVsqzfOaUEqTWMfhHpN0CFjCXC-cLddRub9/pubhtml).

### Do I take this course from home?

Yes, the course is taught completely online, allowing you to take it from anywhere. Even though it’s online, it will still feel like you’re in a classroom and part of a vibrant group of students. You’ll be interacting with peers, getting feedback, and learning with hands-on projects.

You’ll get all the learning benefits of an intensive engineering program, but from the comfort of your own home.
