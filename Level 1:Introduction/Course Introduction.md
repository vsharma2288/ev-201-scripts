## Course Content 

### What you will be learning

* Breaking down an EV into its subcomponents
* Typical power ratings of chargers
* Fundamentals of motors used in EVs
* Motor power and torque calculations
* Motor control for BLDC motors
* Weight distribution in EVs
* Specification of EV components
* Fundamentals of thermal management for batteries
* Various power sources (FCEV/BEV)
* Fundamentals of Lithium-ion cells
* Charging of Lithium-ion cells
* Fundamentals of voltage conversion

## What you will be building

As this is an online course, and you will be learning how to build a fully custom electric vehicle powertrain from scratch, you will be expected to build a fully functioning powertrain prototype.

We understand that building a full-sized powertrain would not be feasible for students learning online in the comfort of their homes, as they are expensive and very dangerous to handle without supervision.

Therefore, we will be working with low-power components and using them to emulate a full-sized electric vehicle motor as both components work the same but with lower power requirements.

By the end of the course, you will have built a low-power vehicle control system on your own, a motor controller for a motor, and a battery Management system to monitor Li-ion batteries. You will be able to visualize and understand real-time battery behavior and be able to control it to safely charge and discharge the batteries on a fundamental level using your own programming. 

**Here is an example submission by a student from our previous batch, this is what you will be building.**




## Evaluations

* Course comprises 11 levels overall with 8 weeks of program duration. Each level can be completed within 1 week.

* Most of the levels have graded assignments (target) where the submissions will be evaluated.

* The 11th level is the capstone project to be done after completing 10 levels. This will be evaluated by the EV industry experts.


## Beyond the Course

Although this course is full of good information, we can only cover so much in an 11 level course. So, if you find yourself wanting more after completing each level, there are suggestions given for further reading that you can look through to learn more in-depth.



>"We are engineers, and we only learn something when we test to failure". This is going to be the motto of the entire course.

As you will fail multiple times building the prototypes. But don't worry, we will also learn how to correct and learn from those issues and failures.
