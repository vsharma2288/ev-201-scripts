### Step 1: Gather parts

You will need:
* 1 AA Battery 
* 1 Neodymium Magnet 
* 2 Safety Pins
* 3 Feet or 10 meter of 25 gauge copper enameled coil.

>DO NOT use the Li-ion cells included in your kit for this experiment. 

>Use a regular AA cell for this experiment.

Step 2: Winding the Coil.

Start by taking the wire, and leaving some extra wire at the ends...like 3 inches and about 6-7 cm and coiling it. This will be the rotor of your motor.

Randomly and speedily coil it as shown in the Final image above. Overlapping is fine.

Now, because this is 25 Gauge wire, it is thicker and, when coiled will remain together.

To hold it securely together, hold it and wrap it around the coil a few times.

Now, at the end of the coil, use a knife or a blade to strip the insulation off of the bottoms of the ends.

Next, bend one end of the wire up and the other down

### Step 4: Final Assembly.

Now give the coil a abrupt push and it should spin. If it doesn't well, don't worry. Push it the other way abruptly.

### How does it work?
	
When electricity is passed through a wire coil (as you are doing when you connect the coil to the battery), you create an electromagnetic field, which pushes the coil away from the magnet. When you give the coil a spin, since one side of the wire is insulated, you break the circuit briefly, so the coil continues to rotate using its momentum. When the circuit is complete again, the magnetic field once again repels the coil, so it keeps spinning. The motor can continue to spin until the battery is dead!

You can see the same effect with your coil circuit and a compass.

And wrapping the wire into a coil increases the strength of the magnetic field, so long as the moment of inertia remains small.

The principles that allow this motor to work are the same ones that govern all motors. These motors all turn electromagnetic energy into kinetic energy. Generators work the opposite way, by turning kinetic energy into electromagnetic energy (and in fact, you can turn motors into generators and vice versa, although sometimes it takes a little work).

### Points to remember

Make sure your safety pins have good contact with the battery terminals.

* Make sure you didn't sand off too much of the wire insulationâ€”one end needs to have enough insulation on one side that the circuit is broken as the coil spins.
* If the coil is leaning too far to one side, you may need to rewrap it so it's more symmetrical.
