This standard prescribes the requirements for the measurement of net power and
maximum 30-minute power of Electric Power Train Vehicles. 

### Scope 
This standard applies to the representation 
of motor speed and the power at full load and the
maximum 30 minutes power of electric drive trains intended for the
propulsion for L, M and N categories of electric powertrain Vehicles.

### TEST CONDITIONS

1. This test is conducted by testing the motor using a bench dynamometer, or by directly testing the entire vehicle using a chassis dynamometer.

2. The motor / Vehicle should have been run-in according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations before the test


>Break-in or breaking in, also known as run-in or running in, is the procedure of conditioning a new vehicle by giving it an initial period of running, usually under light load, but sometimes under heavy load or normal load .

3. If the power measurement can be carried out only on a motor with the
gearbox or a reducer mounted, the efficiency of the gearbox will be taken into
account.

### TESTING PROCEDURE 

#### A.  Bench Dynamometer Procedure

1. Fitting Auxiliary equipment.

During the test, the auxiliaries necessary for the motor operation in
the intended application should be installed in the
same position as in the vehicle. this equipment might include Radiator,
Fan,
Fan cowl,
Pump,
Thermostat, etc

2. Auxiliaries to be removed 

The auxiliaries necessary for the proper operation of the vehicle, and
which may be mounted on the motor but are not necessary for the operation of the motor should be removed when performing the test.

The following non-exhaustive list is given as an
example:
- Air compressor for brakes;
- Power steering compressor;
- Suspension system compressor;
- Air conditioner system, etc.

>Where accessories cannot be removed, the power they absorb in the
unloaded condition may be determined and added to the measured
power.

#### B.  Chassis Dynamometer Procedure.

1. While testing the vehicle on a chassis dynamometer, the chassis
dynamometer shall be adjusted for cancelling the friction losses from
the parts of the running vehicle other than the electric power train and
the installed accessories.

2. If the power supply is being taken by the Onboard Battery or REESS of the vehicle, the REESS shall be charged according to the normal charge procedure for a
period not exceeding 12 hour or as per vehicle manufacturer’s
recommendation.

### Accuracy of Measurements 

- Torque: ± 1% of measured torque.
     - The torque measuring system shall be calibrated to take friction losses
into account. The accuracy in the lower half of the measuring range of
the dynamometer bench may be +/- 2% of measured torque.

- Motor Speed: 0.5% of measured speed
- Motor Inlet Air Temperature: ± 2° C.
- Vehicle Speed: + 1 kmph

### DETERMINATION OF NET POWER

1. The motor/vehicle and its entire equipment assembly must be
conditioned at a temperature of 25+/- 5 °C for a minimum of two
hours before start of test.

2. Just before beginning the test, the vehicle/motor shall be run on the
chassis/bench dynamometer for three minutes delivering a power
equal to 80% of the rated maximum power at the speed recommended
by the manufacturer

3. The net power test shall consist of a run at the full setting of the power
controller.

4. Measurements shall be taken at a sufficient number of motor speeds,
(at least four) to define correctly the power curve between lowest and
the highest speeds recommended by the manufacturer.

5. The whole test shall be completed within 5 minutes. It may be
necessary to recharge the batteries once for completion of the power
curve measurement.

### DETERMINATION OF MAXIMUM 30 MINUTE POWER

1. The motor/vehicle and its entire equipment assembly must be
conditioned at a temperature of 25+/- 5 °C for a minimum of four hours
before the test.

2. The electric motor/vehicle shall be run on the bench
dynamometer/chassis dynamometer at a power, which is declared by
manufacturer for a maximum of 30 minutes of power.

3. The speed is recommended to be in a range, at which the net power is
greater than 90% of the maximum power measured in clause 5.0. This
speed shall be recommended by the manufacturer.

4. Speed and power shall be recorded. The power must be in a range of
± 5% of the power value at the start of the test. The maximum
30 minutes power is the average of the power within the 30 minutes
period.
