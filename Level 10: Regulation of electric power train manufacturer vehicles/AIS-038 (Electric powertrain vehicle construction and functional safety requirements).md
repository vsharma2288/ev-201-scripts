### SPECIFICATION AND TESTS

### 1. Protection against electric shock

These electrical safety requirements apply to high voltage buses, 
under conditions where they are not connected to external high voltage
power supplies.

### 2. Protection against direct contact

The protection against direct contact with live parts should comply with
the points given below. These protections (solid insulator, barrier,
enclosure, etc.) should not be able to be opened, disassembled or removed
without the use of tools.

   -  For the protection of live parts inside the passenger compartment or luggage
compartment, the protection degree IPXXD as given below in the conditions paragraph shall be
provided.

   - For the protection of live parts in areas other than the passenger compartment
or luggage compartment, the protection degree IPXXB as given below in the conditions paragraph should be satisfied. 

In the case of open L category vehicles where luggage compartment and
passenger compartment are not clearly distinguished (Scooter or a bike or Rikshaw), for protection of
live parts inside areas which can be accessed only with the use of tools, the
protection degree IPXXB shall be provided and for other live parts
protection degree IPXXD shall be provided.
Note: Accessing an area by opening a lock with a key is not considered
as using a tool.

#### Conditions

#### A. Instruments used for the testing
The Tests are carried out with the help of **Access probes**, these Access probes are a substitution to using Human fingers and are designed to simulate a human finger as shown below.

https://do7js0tdxrds1.cloudfront.net/sjgbaoyvyc4fnqgt7irhaxfor9u6?response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Vehicle+Category+L+%282%29.png%22%3B&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&Expires=1701254066&Signature=CbgPY15BksAnH3qF0E6OPZSXM~kndTOJRoVKWt8FxEXciAwOJAAhRVbsIpq8-wY79oCsQYFZcreadsc3zCYcdNFPkAfVFJs965hvZ-MpC2Ia3X6Qr1D8ISqibUTGTsDa9B9fNAaBrxARpR3aXqaQHxYXgIqWcyCnzmg2FP6DYWXwzcLRviWecYoV7i-wWGgot1E1BsC0xWKa8ZLZU4C9JoMDq3gMJOuoyZ8jSRDvH3EYgggYZp2q90YMVhjOqbH~PMwl5MxmcCDqTQBzId0DbVhdVkvF~RXZ1AkQZmxUQgLZJZLrICeGCpxmZ-tpZJ74QjXLwuQVZnZurdZbVPT30Q__&Key-Pair-Id=K2Q3HDJ6ZAQGFF


#### B. Test Conditions.

The **access probe** is pushed against any openings of the enclosure with
the force of 10 newtons or 1 kg. If it partly or fully penetrates, it is placed in
every possible position, but in no case should the stop face fully penetrate
through the opening.

Internal barriers are considered part of the enclosure.

A low-voltage supply (of not less than 40 V and not more than 50 V) in
series with a suitable lamp should be connected, if necessary, between the
probe and live parts inside the barrier or enclosure.

The signal-circuit method should also be applied to the moving live parts
of high voltage equipment.

Internal moving parts may be operated slowly, where this is possible.

#### C. Conditions to pass the test. 

The Access probe does not touch live parts, i.e this is identified by the lamp connected in series to the probe. 


In the case of the test for **IPXXB**, the jointed test finger can penetrate to
it's 80 mm in length, but the stop face (diameter 50 mm x 20 mm) (Check the image below for reference) should not
pass through the opening. 

Starting from the straight position, both joints
of the test, the finger should be successively bent through an angle of up to 90
degree with respect to the axis of the adjoining section of the finger and
shall be placed in every possible position.

In the case of the tests for **IPXXD**, the access probe may penetrate to its full
length, but the stop face shall not fully penetrate through the opening.

#### D. Protection against direct contact with live parts at the **connectors**.

The Connectors should meet these requirements if 
   - They have a suitable IPXXB or IPXXD rating.
   - If they are located underneath the floor of the vehicle.
   - If they have a locking mechanism that needs to be removed with a tool.
   - If the voltage of live parts drops below 60 volts or AC 30V rms within 1 second after separating the connector. 

#### Service disconnect connectors

if the service disconnect connector can be opened, disassembled or removed without tools, it is acceptable if the protection degree IPXXB is satisfied.

### [Have a look at this file for a comprehensive guide to IP degrees of protection.](http://www.bauergear.info/Main/DANWeb/Vault/CommLit/EP101E_ms.pdf)

#### E. Protection against In-direct contacts.

   - For protection against electrical shock which could arise from indirect
contact, the exposed conductive parts, such as the conductive barrier
and the enclosure should be connected securely to the electrical
chassis by connection with electrical wire or ground cable, or by
welding, or by connection using bolts, etc. so that no dangerous
potentials are produced.

   - The resistance between all exposed conductive parts and the electrical chassis should be lower than 0.1 ohm when there is a current flow of at
least 0.2 amperes. This requirement is satisfied if the 
connection has been established by welding.

### 3. Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) or a Battery pack

   - The REESS Should not overheat. If the REESS is subject to overheating
due to excessive current, it should be equipped with a protective device
such as fuses, circuit breakers or main contactors.

   - When leaving the vehicle, the driver should be informed by a signal (e.g.
optical or audible signal) if the vehicle is still switched on.

### 4. Protection against water.

After each exposure to water (vehicles still wet), the electrical system of the vehicle should not be shorted. the resistance between the terminals should be at least 100 ohms/V of the nominal voltage, and before the water test, the resistance should be at least 500 ohm/V of the nominal voltage.

### 4. Protection against washing.

This test is intended to simulate a normal washing of Electric Power Train
vehicles, but not specific cleaning using high water pressure or underbody
washing. 

The test uses a hose nozzle according to IPX5 as specified in IEC 60529. Using fresh water with a flow rate of
12.5 l/min, all borderlines shall be exposed and followed in all directions
with the water stream at a speed rate of 0.1 m/s, keeping a distance of 3 m
between the nozzle aperture and the borderline.

### 5. Protection against flooding.

This test is intended to simulate the driving of an Electric Power Train
vehicles on flooded streets or in water puddles.

The vehicle shall be driven in a wading pool, 10 cm in-depth, over a distance
of 500 m at a speed of 20 km/h resulting in a time of approximately
1.5 min.

If the wading pool used is less than 500 m in length, it has to be
driven through several times, the total time including the periods outside
the wading pool shall be less than 10 min.

### 5. Protection against heavy rainstorms.

This test is intended to simulate a sudden heavy rainstorm e.g. a
thunderstorm, when opening parts especially to access to the passenger,
load and motor compartments are open except those requiring one or more
tools.

This test uses a spray nozzle according to IPX3 as specified in IEC 60529.
Using freshwater with a flow rate of 10 l/min, 

All surfaces with normally opening parts will be exposed for 5 min, possibly through a regular movement of the spray nozzle.
