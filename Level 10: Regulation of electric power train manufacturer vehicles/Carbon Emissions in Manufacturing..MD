> A carbon footprint is defined as “The quantity of Greenhouse Gases emitted into the atmosphere by an individual, organization, product or event within a specified boundary”.

From the videos, we see that carbon dioxide is one of the most commonly known gases contributing to global warming, but it is not the only one to be considered when calculating emissions and a carbon footprint.

There are 7 total greenhouse gases considered and calculated when measuring a for the total carbon footprint of an entity. 

These are 

* Carbon dioxide (CO~2~)
* Methane (CH~4~)
* Nitrous oxide (N~2~O)
* Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
* Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
* Sulfur hexafluoride (SF~6~)
* Nitrogen trifluoride (NF~3~)

For example, carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and also as a result of certain chemical reactions (e.g., manufacturing of cement).

Methane is emitted during production of coal, natural gas, and oil and its transportation. 

Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices, as well as land use and the composting of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills. Although the amount of methane emitted globally is 8-10, smaller than carbon dioxide, its [GWP (global warming potential)](https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/Global-Warming-Potential-Values%20%28Feb%2016%202016%29_1.pdf) is 28. That means that **methane warms the atmosphere 28 times more than carbon.**

#### **What does a company’s carbon footprint mean?**

Thanks to the GHG Protocol, each activity company undertakes can be calculated in one simple number – a CO~2~e (carbon dioxide equivalent or often referred to as GHG or carbon footprint).

For example:

* Nike FY2021 GHG emissions are **119,141 tons of CO~2~e** (44% reduction from 2020)
* IKEA FY21 is estimated to be **26.2 million tonnes of CO~2~e**, a decrease of 5.8% in absolute terms compared to the baseline FY16, but an increase of 5.7% compared to FY20.
* Coca-Cola’s global manufacturing sites produced **5.24 million metric tons of GHG emissions** in 2020. This was a reduction of six percent compared to 2019 levels.

For context, **an average tree absorbs 25 kg of CO~2~ per year**. So we can estimate that it would take:

* 4,765,640 trees to absorb Nike FY2021 GHG emissions
* 1,048,000,000 trees to absorb IKEA FY2021 GHG emissions
* 209,600,000 trees to absorb Coca-Cola 2020 GHG emissions.

All activities that go into producing an item contribute to the company’s total carbon footprint. 

For example, in cement manufacturing, the production of cement requires burning it, and during the process, the key ingredient, limestone, releases CO~2~ emissions.

Carbon emissions in cement manufacturing can be neutralized by implementing carbon capture plants to become carbon-neutral.

### How Manufacturing Companies Calculate Their Carbon Footprint

According to the [GHG protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) the basic process of calculating the total carbon footprint, consists of 3 Scopes,

* **Scope 1** refers to emissions the company is responsible for directly, for example, energy used in the company facilities or fuel used to drive company vehicles.

* **Scope 2** included all the activities that the company is accountable for indirectly, for example, waste generated in operations, business travel and employee commute, and purchased goods and services.

* [**Scope 3**](https://www.planetmark.com/scope-3-carbon-footprint-guidelines/#:~:text=Scope%203%20includes%20all%20other,to%2090%25%20of%20total%20emissions.) is the most complicated part of the calculation. Still, it’s also the one that can sum up to 90% of a company’s carbon footprint. The activities included here are the transportation of the products, use of sold products, end-of-lifecycle treatment of sold products, etc.
