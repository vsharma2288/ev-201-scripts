This standard prescribes the safety requirements of batteries and battery packs for battery-operated vehicles.

## Scope

This standard applies to the traction (driving power) batteries used for
battery operated vehicles of L, M and N category vehicles.

## List of tests being carried out

1. Short Circuit Test (Cell Level or Battery Module or Battery Pack) 
2. Overcharge Test (Cell Level or Battery module or Battery Pack)
3. Vibration Test 
4. Shock Test
5. Roll-Over Test (Battery Module) (applicable only for flooded lead
acid batteries)
6. Penetration Test (Cell Level or Battery module) 

## Test Requirements


### 1. Short Circuit Test (Cell Level or Battery Module or Battery Pack) 

Test may be carried out on a battery cell (if the electrodes are
approachable) or battery module or battery pack, as opted by the
manufacturer

At the end of the test, there shall be no :
 1.  Physical damage to the casing or other mechanical parts.
 2.  Melting of components.
 3.  Fire or explosion.
 
It is acceptable for the battery to become dry at the end of the test. 

### 2. Overcharge Test (Cell Level or Battery module or Battery Pack)

At the end of the test, there shall be no :
1.  Physical damage to the casing or other mechanical parts.
2.  Melting of components.
3.  Fire or explosion. 


### 3. Vibration Test

At the end of the test, there shall be no electrolyte loss.

Immediately after the vibration test, discharge the battery at the test room temperature not exceeding 30°C, at the rate of I = 0.2xBattery capacity, declared by the manufacturer. 

The deterioration of battery rated capacity shall not be more than 10%.

At the end of the test, there shall be no :
1.  Physical damage to the casing or other mechanical parts.
2.  Fire or explosion. 

### 5. Shock Test 

At the end of the test, there shall be no :
1.  Physical damage to the casing or other mechanical parts.
2.  Fire or explosion. 

### 6. Roll-Over Test (Battery Module) (applicable only for flooded lead-acid batteries) 

Rotate the battery module one complete revolution in one direction, for
one minute in a continuous, slow-roll fashion, and observe leakage, if
any, from the battery module. Then rotate the battery module in 90°
increments in the same direction for one full revolution. Hold the battery
module for one hour at each position. 


**At the end of the test:**

The volume of electrolyte spilled in each position shall not be more than 25 ml per module.

#### 7. Penetration Test (Cell Level or Battery module) 

The battery cell module shall be penetrated with mild steel
(conductive) pointed rod, which will be electrically insulated from the
test fixture. The rate of penetration shall be 8 cm/s nominal.

>Note: The test may be carried out using a pendulum, hydraulic or pneumatic actuator.

| Size of Test Object | Diameter of Rod | Minimum Depth of Penetration  |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Battery Cell        | 3 mm            | Through cell                  |
| Battery Module      | 20 mm           | Through three cells or 100 mm |


**At the end of the test, there shall be no:**
1.  Melting of components.
2.  Fire or explosion.
