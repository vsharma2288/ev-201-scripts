## What is Homologation?


The term **Homologation** is derived from the Greek homologeo means “to agree”, which signifies getting approval by an Official and Authorized Agency / Authority. This may be any Judicial Department, a Government Department, or any Authorized Agency that works as per strict guidelines/rules/standards to arrive at a decision whether such approval should be given or not.

In every country, every vehicle Petrol or Electric needs to get type approvals in accordance with the Official standards for all of its sub-systems and components prior to its sale. 

These Rules and Standards are made in such a way that it aims at improving Vehicle safety (both active and passive), environmental Safety and also Product Quality, this also ends up improving the production process.

#### The homologation process consists of several steps:

- Component approval (lamps, mirrors, tires etc.)
- Component fitting to the vehicle (electric/electronic sub-assemblies, car audio systems etc.)
- System approvals (breaking, exhaust emission etc.)
- Whole vehicle type approval ( WVTA ) / Vehicle certification test.


For each Vehicle, the Indian Authorized Agency (like ARAI, ICAT, etc.) issues a **“TYPE APPROVAL CERTIFICATE (TAC)”** and/or **“CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE (COP)”** according to each applicable **CMVR** based on test reports. 

This certificate is recognized in all Countries as mentioned in the test Report.

## What is CMVR?

CMVR is short for **“Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989”**. In India, the rules and regulations related to driver’s license, registration of motor vehicles, control of traffic, construction & maintenance of motor vehicles, etc. are governed by the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA),1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR Rules 1989).

The Ministry of Road Transport, Highways & Shipping (MoRTH) acts as a Nodal agency for the formulation and implementation of various provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and CMVR 1989.

#### CMVR has divided various vehicles into different categories to make it easier to apply all the needed rules. 

As per Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR 1989) and its amendments, vehicles are categorized in various categories denoted by alphabets like L, M, N, T, A, C, etc.
