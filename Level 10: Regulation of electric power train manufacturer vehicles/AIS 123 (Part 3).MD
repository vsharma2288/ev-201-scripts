### Definitions and test procedures

#### 1. Electric Propulsion Kit

An Electric Propulsion Kit is an aggregate of components added by a kit manufacturer/ supplier to the
base vehicle by replacing IC engine and associated accessories for pure
electric operation.

#### 2. Weighing of the vehicle

Vehicle weight shall be done as per IS 11825-1986 with Electric
Propulsion Kit fitted. Permissible increase in vehicle unladen weight due to
Electric Propulsion Kit shall be 25% for L5M,M1/M2 and M3 vehicles, and will be equal to the weight of the electric propulsion kit for L5N/N1 and N2.

#### 3. COAST DOWN TEST

Coast down test shall be done as per IS 14785-2000 to find out vehicle road
load coefficients for range and electric energy consumption tests.
At the choice of the kit manufacturer/supplier, the power table method can be
used to determine vehicle road load coefficients for vehicles of category L5,
M1, M2 and N1.


#### 4. GRADEABILITY TEST

The vehicle fitted with Electric Propulsion Kit shall meet the requirement of
gradeability as specified in AIS-049(Rev 1), as per AIS-003.

#### 5. Measurement of Electric Range and Electric Energy Consumption

The electric range of vehicles fitted with Electric Propulsion Kit shall be
measured as per regulations learned in previous levels

The electric energy consumption of vehicle fitted with Electric Propulsion
The kit shall be measured as per regulations learned in previous levels

Reference mass for chassis dynamometer setting shall be as per AIS 049(Rev1) and the Driving cycle shall be as per clause 5.1 of AIS-039(Rev 1):2015
Results of electric range (in km) and electric energy consumption (Wh/km)
shall be reported.

#### 5. BRAKE PERFORMANCE

The vehicle fitted with Electric Propulsion Kit shall meet the requirements of
brake performance test when tested as per IS 11852-2001.

#### 6. TRACTION MOTOR TEST

Motor Power Test: Test shall be carried out as per AIS-041(Rev 1):2015.

#### 7. REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL SAFETY

The vehicle fitted with Electric Propulsion Kit shall meet requirements for
constructional and functional safety as per AIS-038(Rev 1):2015.

#### 8. REQUIREMENTS FOR RECHARGEABLE ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM (REESS).

 The REESS of the Electric Propulsion Kit shall meet the requirements of
AIS-048.

### CODE OF PRACTICE FOR FITMENT OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION KIT ON VEHICLES

This code of practice shall apply to the design, installation, operation,
inspection and testing and maintenance of Electric Propulsion Kit. In
general, the standard is directed towards vehicle installations.

#### Responsibility of Electric Propulsion Kit manufacturer / supplier

1. The fitment of the Electric Propulsion Kit shall be type approved by any
one of the testing agencies specified in Rule 126 of the Central Motor
Vehicle Rules. The responsibility of the type approval and ensuring that
the kit manufactured complies with the provisions thereof shall be that
of the Electric Propulsion Kit manufacturer /supplier.

2. Electric Propulsion Kit manufacturer/ supplier shall have third party
ISO-9000 certification. The ISO 9000 certificate shall be submitted to
the Test Agency at the time of type approval.


3. Electric Propulsion Kit Layout: The layout indicates the locations of
key elements of the kit shall be prepared by the kit manufacturer /
supplier and shall be submitted to the testing agency at the time of type
approval. This will include the placement of each important element
such as motor, controller, wiring harness routing, batteries, charging
socket and other components which forms an integral part of the
Electric Propulsion Kit.

4. Test Agency shall verify the weight distribution due to Electric
Propulsion Kit installation for any adverse impact on vehicle structure
using best engineering practices.

5. Serviceability and accessibility of the original vehicle shall not be
adversely affected due to Electric Propulsion Kit mounting.
