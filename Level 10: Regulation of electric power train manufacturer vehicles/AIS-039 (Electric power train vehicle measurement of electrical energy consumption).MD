### SCOPE

This standard specifies the method for measurement of electrical energy consumption expressed in Wh/km for L, M & N categories of
Electric Power Train Vehicles as defined in Rule 2 (u) of CMVR.

### 1. Preparing the Vehicle for testing 

- The vehicle tyres shall be inflated to the pressure specified by the
vehicle manufacturer when tyres are at the ambient temperature.

- The lubricants for the mechanical moving parts should conform to the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer.

- The lighting, light – signalling and auxiliary devices will be off, except those required for testing and usual daytime operation of the vehicle.

- All energy storage systems available for other than traction purpose (electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, etc.) should be charged up to their maximum level specified by the manufacturer.

> The vehicle must have undergone at least 300 km during the seven
days before the test with those REESS that are installed in the test
vehicle. The seven days period can be waived on the request of vehicle
manufacturer.

### 2. The Operation mode / Test methods

>All the tests are conducted at a temperature of between 20 °C and 30 °C. 

>If the ambient condition cannot be met at the time of the test, then based on mutual agreement between test agency and vehicle manufacturer, the requirement of ambient temperature the condition can be waived.


### 3. The test method includes the four following steps: 

1. Initial charge of the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS); 

2. Application of 34 cycles of Indian Driving Cycle (of 108 s duration each) for
 L category of vehicles .
   - or, 22 Cycles of Part 1 of MIDC (of 195 s duration each) for M1, M2
(with GVW upto 3500 kg) and N category of vehicles. 
   - or, 25 Cycles of Delhi Driving Cycle for M2 (with GVW above 3500
kg) and M3 category of vehicles.

3. Re-charging the REESS(Battery pack);

4. Calculation of the electric energy consumption.

Between the steps, if the vehicle needs to be moved, it is pushed to the
following test area (without regenerative recharging).

>AIS-039 Follows a similar procedure as done by you in Level 4 of EV 201.
